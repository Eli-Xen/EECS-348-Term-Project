# EECS-348-Term-Project
#### Arithmetic Expression Evaluator- term-long project for EECS 348 Fall 2024

An executable of the lastest release of the Arithmetic Expression Evaluator (AEE), as well as a zipped folder with all the code for that release, is available in the "releases" section. The executable of the AEE is the optimal method of running and/or testing the AEE. 

To navigate this repository, please look through the respective branches to look at documents, code, and the meeting log. All code is available both under the "releases" section and in the "implementation" branch; all UPEDU documents pertaining to the AEE are available under the "documents" branch, and current meeting logs are available both in "main" and "meeting logs" branches. 

The AEE was coded, compiled, and tested on the University of Kansas EECS Linux servers. Running the AEE on other servers may result in undefined behavior.
