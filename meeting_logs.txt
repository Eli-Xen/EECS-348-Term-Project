Met in-person at Anschutz Library.
Daniel, Eliza, Tyler, and Lillian were in attendance.
Max and Johnny were not present.

Before the meeting, Lillian volunteered to take meeting logs.
Eliza volunteered to be project manager. 
Members discussed their experience with C and C++: Eliza has the most experience with C++. 
Members discussed potential meeting times: it was agreed upon to meet every Tuesday in Anschutz at 12:15-12:50, with additional calls as necessary at nights on Discord.
Members discussed how to organize the Discord: Daniel decided to make a Discord server with different channels. Members then discussed the organization of the different channels.
Eliza attempted to reach out to Max on multiple occasions via email and social media with no response, so she contacted the lab TAs for assistance with communication.
Eliza created a Github repository for the term project and invited members.
Members discussed how to fill out the Software Development Plan. It was decided that the project manager will not solely be responsible for filling out the plan; instead, responsibility will be divided evenly amongst the members.
